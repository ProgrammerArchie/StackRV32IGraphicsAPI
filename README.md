# StackRV32IGraphicsAPI
Hello! I'm Best_Archer/ProgrammerArchie, and I'm writing a simple graphics API for StackDoubleFlow's RISC-V implementation (RV32IMA, integer mult/div and atomic extensions) in Minecraft Redstone. The screen didn't have a graphics API written for it yet, so I built one. Supports drawing to individual pixels, drawing lines, and drawing triangles. Written in C, uses no libraries (C standard library or otherwise). Writes to the 32 bit MMIO ports 15 and 16.
